After briefly revising the changes that will take place, we moved on to a brainstorming session concerning after customer support improvements. You'll find a copy of the main ideas developed and discussed in these sessions in the photocopies in front of you. The meeting was declared closed at 11.30."

If you don't mind, I'd like to skip item 1 and move on to item 2: Sales improvement in rural market areas. Jack has kindly agreed to give us a report on this matter. Jack?"

Our sales teams need more accurate information on our customers.\n3. A survey will be completed to collect data on spending habits in these areas.\n4. The results of this survey will be delivered to our sales teams.\n5. We are considering specific data mining procedures to help deepen our understanding."
